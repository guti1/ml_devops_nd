## Running Files
We use pyenv and poetry for dependency management. Thus pyenv should be available on your system (e.g. via Homebrew).
We use thy python version 3.8.12 for this project. 
- install the needed python version via virtualenv ` pyenv install 3.8.12 `
- create the virtualenv for the project as `pyenv virtualenv 3.8.12 ml_devops_p1`
- activate the virtualenv as `pyenv activate ml_devops_p1`
- make sure poetry is available e.g. `pip install poetry`
- install all the projects dependencies as `poetry install` in the project root

In case you need additional packages you can add them as `poetry add package-name==version`, optionally with exact 
versions. Packages can be updated also with poetry as `poetry update`.
