Each of the projects have their own environments, install instructions.

## Project 1: Predict Customer Churn

### Project Description

In this project, we will implement our learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn.

### Running Files

In the project root execute `python churn_library_solution.py` or `python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py` in oder to test out the entire 
pipeline, after the instructions in the project's [README](./project_1/README.md) are executed and the 
requirements are met. After execution the project pipeline gets executed as: 
1. data importing/preparation 
2. exploratory analysis: generating plots for ground feature engineering
3. feature engineering:
4. model fitting: fit models, save model artefacts, feature importance plots, model perfomance eval reports.


### Project 2
